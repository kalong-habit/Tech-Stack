MATLAB is a mathematical software package which can be used for *analysing and solving mathematical and engineering problems* such as *numerical computations*, *graphs plotting*, *programming* and more. MATLAB treat all the variables in form of scalar, vector or matrices form. MATLAB is aimed to give a new users have an overview of how to use the basic and intermediate level of MATLAB and of course to keep this free for students who might be using this book for their course. To start off, MATLAB is a scripting language (Note that I didn't mentioned it is programming language) for data analysis, think of it as a super-powered programmable calculator with useful default functions that are built specifically for math applications.<br>

The name MATLAB itself is an abbreviation for "MATrix LABoratory". Originally, it was a simple interactive matrix calculator in early 1980's. Gradually, it evolves into programming language developed by MathWorks. It started out as a matrix programming language where linear algebra programming was simple. It can be run both under interactive sessions and as a batch job. While other programming languages mostly work with numbers one at a time, MATLAB is designed to operate primarily on whole matrices and arrays. All MATLAB variables are multidimensional arrays, no matter what type of data. A matrix is a two-dimensional array often used for linear algebra.<br>

MATLAB are also designed to be equipped with ***toolboxes***. A toolbox is a package of custom functions and/or classes which are generally for a specific topic ***(such as control system, signal processing or even deep learning)***.The toolboxes are either provided officially by Mathworks and require a expensive license, others can be downloaded for free from the File Exchange.<br>(Source: ***https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/MATLAB_Programming***)<br><br>

In the other words based on my experience, to avoid overcost or failure in trial and error methods for deploying "a real hardware" in doing R&D, MATLAB is helpful for scientist and engineers for designing their systems before deployed into a real systems (hardware prototype). You just design your systems following your dynamical systems model, then convert it into mathematics syntax, then simulate it to MATLAB for achieving your systems result. Following the result, then you can iterate the math model until your system is optimal. Then you can convert it into "a real hardware".<br>

If you still a newbie in MATLAB, don't worry. MATLAB provide you "toolbox" if you need develop your systems but you yet to understand to develop it using dynamical systems model. You just click and drag following your own systems, fill the value that you need, then simulate it. Super easy.<br>

Unfortunately, MATLAB is paid software, and it only being free for student since your college is subscribe (following my experience). But don't worry if you are an Open Source maniac. Octave is a MATLAB alternative if you looking for free software.<br><br>
