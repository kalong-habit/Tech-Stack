## EDA (Electronics Design Automation) :flags: <br> 

Electronic design automation (EDA), also referred to as electronic computer-aided design (ECAD),[1] is a category of software tools for designing electronic systems such as integrated circuits and printed circuit boards. The tools work together in a design flow that chip designers use to design and analyze entire semiconductor chips. Since a modern semiconductor chip can have billions of components, EDA tools are essential for their design; this article in particular describes EDA specifically with respect to integrated circuits (ICs).

Various EDA software that I experienced are:

Since I no longer to design my own PCB (I prefer to buy dev board), for now I'm trying to adapt with open source EDA software **KiCad** and **EasyEDA** :sweat_smile: <br>
